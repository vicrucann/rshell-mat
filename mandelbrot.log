The n input arguments for dhead.sh script are: 
[1] LOGIN : login id to the remote servers (assumed it's the same login for every server)
[2]- PPATH : working directory (will be created if does not exist) on the remote servers; assumed to be the same for each server 
[3..n-4]- IPADDRS : range of ip-addresses of all the servers, assumed they have the same login/psw account 
[n-3]- REMMAT : name of the matlab function (e.g. 'myfunc') that will be copied and launched on remote servers by dremote.sh 
[n-2]- VARMAT : name of the workspace varialbes file (without numering and .mat); these are the variables to copy and load to matlab memory on the remote servers 
[n-1]- SLEEPTIME : integer that indicates number of seconds to pause when waiting for each remote server to complete their computations 
[n] - FRES : name of the local folder where the results will be copied to from the servers
